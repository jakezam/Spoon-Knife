Possible projects I've been thinking about are really based around Web Development, which is pretty general. I'm super interested in the oss library React.js, along with all its other corresponding oss libraries (including bootstrap, Semantic.UI, Fluent UI, etc.) which make building web pages and applications really easy, especially due to all the open source libraries available. Working with building responsive frontends using these is something I would like to explore more. To accomplish this we could use a Common repository to hold a frontend project, which is broken down into 2 main branches, a main for production and a develop to be pushed, along with many feature branches to work on different aspects of the project.
